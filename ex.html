                    Abdulhamid II was the 34th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1876 to 1909. His rule was marked by a period of decline for the empire and <em>significant political and social changes</em>.<br>
                    He implemented various reforms, including the introduction of a constitution in 1876, but later suspended it and ruled as an autocrat.<br>
                    He was the <strong>last powerful sultan</strong> before the empire's dissolution after World War I and also one of the most misunderstood.<br>
                    Abdulhamid II is remembered for his efforts to modernize the empire, but his reign was also characterized by repression and censorship.
